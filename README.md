* [`Personal Blog`](https://potrimba.altervista.org/index.php) : Actively write blog posts about my research projects mainly focused on Software Engineering and Machine Learning.

* [`Send Time Optmization`](https://github.com/pptr3/send-time-optimization) : Send Time Optimization (STO) is an add-on feature that allows marketers the ability to send emails at the most optimal send time to each recipient. We used feature engineering to create meaningful features and then we used deep learning to address this problem. The implemented solution **improved the ratio of opened emails by ∼ 32% and the click ratio by ∼ 12%**.
  
* [`Generate synthetic faces`](https://github.com/pptr3/TablutAI) : Auxiliary classifier generative adversarial network (AC-GAN) model that can generate synthetic conditioned faces with a specific set of attributes (example: generate a face of a woman, with blond hair that smiles). The **FID metric** reached a score of **19.42** for the generation of conditioned synthetic faces and a score of **11.07** for the generation of random synthetic faces.
  
* [`Math assistant`](https://github.com/pptr3/math-assistant) : Implemented and deployed a custom Optical Character Recognition (OCR) within an iOS Mobile application and a Telegram bot for **the recognition of handwritten mathematical expressions**. Implemented a Machine Learning model that understands whether the mathematical expressions are correct or not.
  
* [`Image captioning with Transformers`](https://github.com/pptr3/image-captioning-keras) : Implemented the Image Captioning model using deep learning with **Transformers**. The model has been trained both on COCO and Flickr8k datasets. The performance reached results comparable to the **state-of-the-art** of 2020 on the BLEU and METEOR metrics.
