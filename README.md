* [`Personal Blog`](https://petrupotrimba.altervista.org/index.php) : Actively writing blog posts about my research projects mainly focused on Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP and Computer Vision. Give it a look!

* [`Send Time Optmization`](https://github.com/pptr3/send-time-optimization) : Send Time Optimization (STO) is an add-on feature that allows marketers the ability to send emails at the most optimal send time to each recipient. We used feature engineering to create meaningful features and then we used deep learning to address this problem.
  
* [`Image captioning using attention`](https://github.com/pptr3/image-captioning-keras) : Image captioning using **Bahdanau and Luong attention** applied on **COCO and Flickr8k datasets**. The performances have been measured using BLEU and METEOR scores.
  
* [`Generate synthetic faces with specific attributes`](https://github.com/pptr3/face-generation-gan-keras) : Auxiliary classifier generative adversarial network (**AC-GAN**) model that is able to generate synthetic faces conditioned with a specific set of attributes. **All the CelebA attributes** have been taken into account. **FID score: 19.42**.
  
* [`Road signs recognition`](https://github.com/pptr3/road-sings-recognition-pytorch) : **Multiclass classification** model for the recognition of 21 different road signs used in **autonomous car systems**.
  
* [`AI that plays Tablut better than you.`](https://github.com/pptr3/TablutAI) : Tablut is a board game. You can think of it as if it were the game of chess. We created an AI that plays the game using **Min-Max** with **Alpha-Beta pruning**. The AI can easily beat a non expert human player.
